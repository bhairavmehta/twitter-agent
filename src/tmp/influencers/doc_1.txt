He got paid $2M for their NFT deployment and market making services and then just disappeared with the money. This is prior to him being chosen as the preferred deplyment partner of Meteora by Ben. https://t.co/wHBczoDIuCUsername: beaniemaxiCreated at: 2025-02-20T15:58:08+00:00Tweet: Hayden and Gideon in the middle of this pic. https://t.co/JPs9e1BCccUsername: beaniemaxiCreated at: 2025-02-20T15:52:30+00:00Tweet: The Defituna guy wasn't lying. They really do sit around a hookah with smoke coming out of their ears. Cell phones out and sniper bots ready. Just waiting for that CA before the info goes public. This is not a serious industry. https://t.co/zoiMcnft1PUsername: beaniemaxiCreated at: 2025-02-20T15:43:55+00:00Tweet: "My 17 year old son Hayden, who I didn't see much growing up, is now a Limu promoter."Actually diabolical.Username: beaniemaxiCreated at: 2025-02-20T14:56:32+00:00Tweet: Tom Davis, Hayden's dad and the Chairman of Kelsier, was a major part of the Limu pyramid scheme. Following its collapse, he moved the family to Barcelona. He's a convicted felon, with federal convictions for fraud and identity theft. This is "Dr. Tom", Meteora's trusted partner. https://t.co/bfA60ElJxGUsername: beaniemaxiCreated at: 2025-02-20T14:38:45+00:00Tweet: Sydni literally went from working at Orangetheory and a tanning salon to part of the team that is the preferred deployment partner of Meteora / Jupiter. Managing billions of dollars in liqiidity and access to the most senstive market moving insider information. https://t.co/9VrDavxlWMUsername: beaniemaxiCreated at: 2025-02-20T14:27:03+00:00Tweet: People are speculating that Sydni at Kelsier is just an AI image. But she's real. Her name is Sydni Ginn. She's Gideon's fiance. She's heavily involved in the scam. And flies around everywhere on private jets partying with them. She wiped her socials clean as well. Cache exists. https://t.co/MJt2LT5DmEUsername: beaniemaxiCreated at: 2025-02-20T04:11:11+00:00Tweet: Just watched this. If you think you have been screwed by these insiders, you aren't wrong. But it's way worse than you can ever imagine. Go watch the video now. https://t.co/ABc6uxSqGaUsername: beaniemaxiCreated at: 2025-02-20T02:32:29+00:00Tweet: https://t.co/wb7m5iM7MUUsername: beaniemaxiCreated at: 2025-02-20T02:32:27+00:00Tweet: https://t.co/4AoyIHsk2HUsername: beaniemaxiCreated at: 2025-02-20T02:32:26+00:00Tweet: Was able to recreate a now removed About page of the Kelsier site using some new archive tools.Maybe somebody will come forward, and tell Hayden to do the right thing and send the refunds?Lots of interesting Kelsier names here. Some maybe you weren't aware of.Thread below https://t.co/cNNbgDpH37Username: beaniemaxiCreated at: 2025-02-20T00:07:45+00:00Tweet: If you want tokens to be taken seriously as an asset class, real disclosures have to be standard. This is why we aren't seeing the expected demand growth for utility tokens. Everything is too opaque. All we get are vague pie charts with supposed token allocations. Not sufficient.Username: beaniemaxiCreated at: 2025-02-20T00:07:45+00:00Tweet: In traditional financial markets, a CEO discloses a stock sale plan. Stock naturally drops. In this case, Palantir fell 12%. But in crypto, the advance knowledge of an executive's token sale plan is typically hidden. And if you're an insider, you'll likely know. That's "an edge". https://t.co/CUqNht43YQ
