Question 46:
People always love to see new things, would be interesting to see how phantom token will perform
Answer 46:
phantom users seem content trading in-wallet. $29M from in-app swaps last month probably dampens the urgency for a token

Question 47:
Hey When do you think phantom will drop their token?
Answer 47:
probably waiting for 29m revenue first

Question 48:
I am indifferent üòê Which side do you belong ?
Answer 48:
$29M fees in a month is serious capital

Question 49:
If we project Phantom revenue: $290 Million per year will be the net income. Similar companies trade at a P/E ratio of 15. Valuation ‚âà $290 million √ó 15 = $4.35 billion FDV at launch. While Uniswap annualized DeFi revenue is $1.77 billion while trading at $10 billion FDV. Seems like Uniswap is underrated or I am missing smth. Although, can we compare DeFi hub like Uniswap to a wallet like Phantom
Answer 49:
not sure about PE 15x for a non sticky revenue stream like swap fees but uniswap def undervalued by market
